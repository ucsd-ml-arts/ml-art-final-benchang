# Final Project

Benjamin Chang, bmc011@ucsd.edu


## Abstract Proposal

The goal for this project is to generate visual images that can have particular types of desired art styles or patterns. This can be useful for creative designers who wish to see what their artwork would look like in a particular style or with specific types of features or patterns. It can be used for the inspiration of new art styles as well. The method for this project is neural networks which is arguably the most popular machine-learning method to date. The three networks used in this project are DeepDream, StyleTransfer, and CycleGAN. This project is based off of the third generative visual project. The use of CycleGAN is the addition to the final project. This work will be presented regarding the creative goals, the techniques used, and the results.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mgIxwX1VseLyeM9uPSv5GJQgRWNFqtBZ0GKE9d4Qxww).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
    - g_model_AtoB_######.h5
    - g_model_BtoA_######.h5
- training data
    - human2animal.zip
- testing data
    - human2animal.zip
    - custom_data

## Code

Your code for generating your project:

- Jupyter notebooks: CycleGAN
        - https://datahub.ucsd.edu/user/bmc011/notebooks/ml-art-final-benchang/Final%20Project.ipynb#

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
