# Final Project

Benjamin Chang, bmc011@ucsd.edu


## Abstract Proposal

The goal for this project is to generate visual images that can have particular types of desired art styles or patterns. This can be useful for creative designers who wish to see what their artwork would look like in a particular style or with specific types of features or patterns. It can be used for the inspiration of new art styles as well. The method for this project is neural networks which is arguably the most popular machine-learning method to date. The three networks used in this project are DeepDream, StyleTransfer, and CycleGAN. This project is based off of the third generative visual project. The use of CycleGAN is the addition to the final project. This work will be presented regarding the creative goals, the techniques used, and the results.
